# Invert Your Participation Mode
## How Open Spaces Conferences Change Everything (and How to Run One)

# Who Am I?

 - I'm not an event professional (I'm a software developer)
 - but I've participated in a _lot_ of Open Spaces
 - And I've put on a few too

---

I've made this deck so you can use it to help you put on an Open Space.

# What Are Open Spaces?

--- 

What's the best thing that happened at the last conference you attended?

 - It was most likely a hallway conversation, 
 - or a quick chat you had with a speaker after their talk
 - or perhaps a chance meetup in an after-hours pub with someone who went to the same session you did

---

# Open Spaces are a simple methodology for Self Organising conferences

They take the best bits, and make a whole experience out of them.

---

Sessions are conversations, curated and led entirely by attendees

---

Prepare to be surprised by the depth and breadth of topics that are discussed

---

Frequently other aspects self-organise too

---

Each Open Space experience is unique in some way.

(Quite often topics will be raised which are off the topic of the originally proposed topic) 

---

So what do you (the Event Professional) need to do?

 - Source the theme / topic
 - Find and book the space
 - Create the empty agenda
 - Welcome attendees and kick things off 
 
(more on each of these later)

# What Open Spaces Aren't
